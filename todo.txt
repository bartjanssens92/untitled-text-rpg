Things to do:
------------

*Any attempt to kill the goblin without the sword will result in the player dying.

*Add a "cave" with the entrance west of the goblin.
    *A series of rooms in a maze-like pattern that all have the same description, e.g. "You stumble about in the darkness."
    *Only have descriptions of what's around you if player has a light source
    *Have a cave room where you fall to your death if you're doing it blind, make this room avoidable to get through the cave
    *The cave needs an exit to a different area.
*Goblin alcohol interaction:
    *After killing the goblin, inspecting it will reveal it's holding a bottle of alcohol
    *You can take the bottle, and then either drink it or pour it out
    *If you drink it, you pass out, and wake up near the well without your sword.
*Fairy circle
    *You can step inside the mushroom circle, and see fairies show up when you're inside
    *If you have a bottle, you can catch one, this is a lightsource.


*Add more "detail" to the world by adding more things to look at
*More commands like "take a nap"
*More sarcasm
*Add more colour to different types of text
